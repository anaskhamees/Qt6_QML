The **Qt Framework** is a comprehensive  **cross-platform development toolkit** that enables developers to create applications and user interfaces for multiple platforms (such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and embedded systems) using a unified codebase.

>A **framework** is a collection of pre-written code that provides a structure and reusable components for software development. 

It provides a rich set of **libraries**, **tools**, and **APIs** that simplify the development of **graphical user interfaces (GUIs)**, as well as non-GUI functionalities such as networking, database handling, file I/O, threading, and more.

### 3. Qt Core

**Qt Core** is a fundamental module of the Qt framework that provides the basic building blocks for all Qt-based applications. It offers essential non-GUI functionality such as event handling, object communication, and data structures. Since it’s the backbone of the Qt framework, almost every other module in Qt depends on Qt Core.

------

### 3.1. **Features of Qt Core**

1. **Object Management**:
   - Provides the `QObject` base class for all Qt objects, supporting features like:
     - **Signals and Slots**: A mechanism for object communication.
     - **Event Handling**: Processing and propagating events within the application.
2. **Data Structures**:
   - Includes efficient and versatile container classes like:
     - `QList`, `QVector`, `QMap`, `QHash`, etc.
3. **File and Resource Management**:
   - File I/O with classes like `QFile` and `QDir`.
   - Resource management through `.qrc` files.
4. **Timers and Threads**:
   - Manage tasks using `QTimer` for periodic execution.
   - Multi-threading support with classes like `QThread` and `QMutex`.
5. **Text and String Handling**:
   - Unicode-based string manipulation with `QString`.
   - Regular expression handling via `QRegularExpression`.
6. **Localization and Internationalization**:
   - Support for translations and locale-specific functionality (`QLocale`).
7. **Time and Date**:
   - Classes like `QDate`, `QTime`, and `QDateTime` for working with temporal data.
8. **Plugin Framework**:
   - Loadable plugins with `QPluginLoader`.

### 4. Qt Modeling Language (QML)

Qt QML is a declarative language for designing modern UIs. It emphasizes:

- **Declarative Syntax**: Describes what the UI should look like and how it behaves.
- **Dynamic and Reactive Programming**: Simplifies handling user interactions and animations.
- **JavaScript Integration**: For logic and dynamic behavior.
- **Qt Quick**: The accompanying runtime framework for creating animated and fluid user interfaces.



### 5. Difference Between Qt Quick (QML) and Qt Widgets

#### 6. Qt Building Blocks
Qt 6 consists of a large number of modules. In general, a **module is a library for the developer to use**. Some modules are mandatory for a Qt-enabled platform and form the set called **Qt Essentials Modules.** Other modules are optional, and form the **Qt Add-On Modules.** The majority of developers may not need to use the latter, but it’s good to know about them as they provide invaluable solutions to common challenges.

#### 6.1. Qt Modules
The Qt Essentials modules are mandatory for any Qt-enabled platform. They offer the foundation to develop modern Qt 6 Applications using Qt Quick 2. The full list of modules is available in the Qt documentation module list  [HERE](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtmodules.html#qt-essentials).

#### 6.2. Core-Essential Modules
It is the minimal set of Qt 6 modules to start QML programming.

- **Qt Core** - Core non-graphical classes used by other modules.
- **Qt D-BUS**- Classes for inter-process communication over the D-Bus protocol on linux.

  Besides the essential modules, Qt offers additional modules that target specific purposes. Many add-on modules are either feature-complete and exist for backwards compatibility, or are only applicable to certain platforms. Here is a list of some of the available add-on modules, but make sure you familiarize yourself with them all in the Qt documentation add-ons list (opens new window)and in the list below.

- **Network:** Qt Bluetooth / Qt Network Authorization

- **UI Components**: Qt Quick 3D / Qt Quick Timeline / Qt Charts / Qt Data Visualization / Qt Lottie Animation / Qt Virtual Keyboard
