# Qt Framework Histroy



### **1. Origins and Early Development**

- **1990–1991**:
  - **Eirik Chambe-Eng** and **Haavard Nord**, two Norwegian software engineers, conceptualized a cross-platform toolkit. They aimed to build a library that could abstract away platform-specific details while maintaining high performance.
  - Haavard Nord worked on the initial implementation in 1991.
- **1992–1994**:
  - The project was formalized as "Qt." The name "Qt" came from the letter "Q" in the Emacs font that Nord liked, and "t" from "toolkit."
  - They worked on creating the foundation for cross-platform GUI development.

### **2. Trolltech Era (1994–2008)**

- **1994**:
  - **Trolltech AS** was founded (later renamed **Trolltech**). The first version of Qt was released as a commercial product.
- **1995**:
  - **Qt 1.0** was released for **Linux** and **Windows**. It introduced the foundational elements like **signals and slots**, which became a hallmark of Qt’s object communication.
- **1996**:
  - The **KDE (K Desktop Environment)** project adopted Qt as the base for its graphical interface, making it widely popular in the Linux community.
- **1998**:
  - Trolltech released **Qt 2.0**, introducing major improvements, including better support for internationalization.
- **1999**:
  - To address concerns about Qt being proprietary, Trolltech introduced the **Q Public License (QPL)**, allowing open-source usage for free, but with certain restrictions.
- **2000**:
  - **Qt 2.2** introduced support for **macOS** (then called Mac OS X).
- **2001**:
  - **Qt 3.0** was released, adding better database integration, enhanced text handling, and more widgets.

### **3. Nokia Acquisition and Open Source Expansion (2008–2011)**

- **2008**:
  - Trolltech was acquired by **Nokia** for $153 million to integrate Qt into Nokia's mobile platforms.
  - Nokia re-licensed Qt under the **LGPL (Lesser General Public License)** in 2009, making it more accessible to the open-source community.
- **2009**:
  - **Qt 4.5** was released under the LGPL. This version solidified Qt’s dominance as a cross-platform toolkit by supporting more platforms and introducing **Qt WebKit** for web rendering.
- **2010**:
  - Nokia announced its focus on Qt for the **MeeGo** operating system, a Linux-based mobile OS developed in collaboration with Intel.
- **2011**:
  - Nokia released **Qt 4.7**, introducing **Qt Quick** and **QML**, a declarative language designed for building dynamic and fluid user interfaces.
  - Nokia sold its commercial Qt licensing business to **Digia**, signaling its exit from the Qt ecosystem.

------

### **4. Digia Era (2012–2014)**

- **2012**:

  - Nokia officially transferred Qt’s development and rights to **Digia**. Digia continued to expand Qt’s reach and focus on embedded systems.

  - Qt 5.0

     was released, marking a major milestone. It introduced:

    - The **Qt Quick 2.0** framework, powered by a new **Qt Scene Graph** for GPU-accelerated rendering.
    - Modularization, making it easier to include only the parts of Qt needed for a project.

- **2013**:

  - Digia established the **Qt Company** as a separate entity to manage Qt’s development and commercial licensing.

------

### **5. The Qt Company Era (2014–Present)**

- **2015**:
  - **Qt 5.5** introduced support for **IoT (Internet of Things)** devices, furthering Qt’s relevance in embedded systems.
- **2016**:
  - **Qt 5.7** dropped support for LGPL 2.1 and introduced the **GPLv3** license for open-source users, along with the commercial license.
- **2018**:
  - **Qt 5.11** and later releases emphasized performance improvements and support for modern C++ standards, such as C++11 and C++17.
- **2019**:
  - Work began on **Qt 6**, aiming to modernize Qt’s architecture, improve performance, and adapt to new technologies like **Vulkan**, **C++17/20**, and multi-threaded rendering.

------

### **6. Qt 6 Era (2020–Present)**

- **2020**:

  - Qt 6.0

     was released in December. It introduced:

    - A completely modernized architecture.
    - Support for advanced graphics APIs like **Vulkan**, **Metal**, and **Direct3D**.
    - Full support for **C++17** with preparations for C++20.

- **2021–2023**:

  - Subsequent releases in the 

    Qt 6.x

     series focused on:

    - Enhancing support for 3D rendering and multimedia.
    - Expanding tools for cross-platform development on desktop, mobile, and embedded systems.
    - Improvements to Qt Quick and QML for creating responsive UIs.
    - New modules, such as **Qt for Python** (PySide6) for Python developers.

- **2024** (Recent Developments):

  - Qt continues to expand its reach in industries like automotive, industrial automation, and medical devices.
